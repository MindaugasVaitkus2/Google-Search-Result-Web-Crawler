# Google-Search-Result-Web-Crawler

### A web-crawler that can download Google search results as PDF files in your computer

## Task
Build a web-crawler that can search any topic people may be interested in, and download each search result as a PDF file to a specific directory.
For example, people can enter "Pokemon Go" as topic and "/Users/xxx/desktop" as the directory, and then the articles related to Pokemon Go will be saved at their desktop.
